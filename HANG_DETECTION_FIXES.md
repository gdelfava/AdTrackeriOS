# Hang Detection Fixes for AdRadar

## Issue Description
The app was experiencing hang detection during loading with a 0.31s delay, indicating that the main thread was being blocked for more than 300ms during initialization.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Synchronous UserDefaults Access in View Model Init
**Problem:** `SummaryViewModel.init()` was calling `UserDefaultsManager.shared.getLastUpdateDate()` synchronously during initialization.
**Impact:** Blocked main thread during view creation.

### 2. Google Sign-In Session Restoration in AuthViewModel Init
**Problem:** `AuthViewModel.init()` was calling `GIDSignIn.sharedInstance.restorePreviousSignIn` synchronously.
**Impact:** Network operations and token refresh calls blocked the main thread.

### 3. Immediate Network Calls in View OnAppear
**Problem:** `SummaryView.onAppear` was triggering `fetchSummary()` immediately without delays.
**Impact:** Multiple concurrent network requests started synchronously.

### 4. Blocking UserDefaults Synchronization
**Problem:** `UserDefaultsManager` was calling `synchronize()` synchronously on the main thread.
**Impact:** Frequent writes blocked the main thread.

### 5. Synchronous Network Status Checks
**Problem:** Network connectivity checks were performed synchronously in API methods.
**Impact:** Blocked main thread during network assessment.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Asynchronous UserDefaults Access
```swift
// Before: Synchronous access in init
self.lastUpdateTime = UserDefaultsManager.shared.getLastUpdateDate()

// After: Deferred async access
Task {
    await loadLastUpdateTime()
}

private func loadLastUpdateTime() async {
    let lastUpdate = await Task.detached {
        UserDefaultsManager.shared.getLastUpdateDate()
    }.value
    
    await MainActor.run {
        self.lastUpdateTime = lastUpdate
    }
}
```

### 2. Asynchronous Google Sign-In Restoration
```swift
// Before: Synchronous in init
GIDSignIn.sharedInstance.restorePreviousSignIn { ... }

// After: Deferred async method
Task {
    await restoreGoogleSignInSession()
}

private func restoreGoogleSignInSession() async {
    await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in
        GIDSignIn.sharedInstance.restorePreviousSignIn { ... }
    }
}
```

### 3. Delayed View Data Fetching
```swift
// Before: Immediate fetch in onAppear
Task { await viewModel.fetchSummary() }

// After: Delayed async fetch
Task {
    try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 100_000_000) // 0.1 seconds
    
    if let token = authViewModel.accessToken, !viewModel.hasLoaded {
        await MainActor.run {
            viewModel.accessToken = token
            viewModel.authViewModel = authViewModel
        }
        await viewModel.fetchSummary()
    }
}
```

### 4. Asynchronous UserDefaults Synchronization
```swift
// Before: Synchronous sync
if useSharedContainer {
    defaults.synchronize()
}

// After: Async sync on background queue
private func asyncSync() {
    guard useSharedContainer else { return }
    
    Task.detached(priority: .utility) {
        self.safeDefaults().synchronize()
    }
}
```

### 5. Asynchronous Network Status Checks
```swift
// Before: Synchronous network check
guard NetworkMonitor.shared.shouldProceedWithRequest() else {
    return .failure(.requestFailed("No internet connection"))
}

// After: Async network check
let isConnected = await Task.detached {
    NetworkMonitor.shared.isConnected
}.value

guard isConnected else {
    return .failure(.requestFailed("No internet connection"))
}
```

### 6. Progressive View Loading
```swift
// Added initialization state management to SummaryTabView
@State private var isInitialized = false

// Show loading state until async initialization completes
if isInitialized {
    // Show actual views
} else {
    // Show loading indicator
}
```

## Performance Improvements

### Main Thread Optimization
- **Before:** Multiple blocking operations during view initialization
- **After:** All heavy operations deferred to background queues with minimal delays

### View Loading Strategy
- **Before:** All views loaded synchronously causing UI freezes
- **After:** Progressive loading with loading states and async initialization

### Network Operations
- **Before:** Network checks and calls blocked main thread
- **After:** All network operations fully asynchronous

### UserDefaults Operations
- **Before:** Frequent synchronous reads/writes with immediate sync
- **After:** Async reads with background synchronization

## Expected Results

1. **Eliminated 0.31s hang detection** during app startup
2. **Smoother UI transitions** between views
3. **Faster app launch time** with progressive loading
4. **Better user experience** with proper loading states
5. **Reduced memory pressure** with optimized initialization

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Profile with Instruments** to verify main thread is no longer blocked
2. **Test on older devices** to ensure improvements are maintained
3. **Monitor hang detection reports** in production
4. **Verify all loading states** display correctly
5. **Test network connectivity scenarios** to ensure proper error handling

## Future Considerations

1. **Consider lazy loading** for less critical view components
2. **Implement data caching** to reduce repeated network calls
3. **Add telemetry** to monitor app performance metrics
4. **Consider view pooling** for frequently accessed views
5. **Monitor memory usage** to prevent other performance issues
